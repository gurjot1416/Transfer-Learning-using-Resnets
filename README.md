# Transfer-Learning-using-Resnets
The aim of this project is to experiment the application of transfer learning techniques using the ResNet (Residual Networks) architecture for garbage classification. For better sustainability and a clean and green environment garbage classification is of utmost importance, which further implies the need of a robust classification method. Here, Pre-trained models (of ResNet architecture) on large datasets like Imagnet are used, further implying the application of transfer learning techniques is done. Thus implying the knowledge gained from pre-existing problems to new unseen problems. Further, the ResNet architecture or deep residual learning which is known for its skip/ shortcut connections provide a good and efficient result and is making the model converge properly. This project aims to build a robust garbage classification model, contributing to efficient waste management.
The Project Report and PDF are also uploaded.
